## Code of Conduct

Help us keep KumoCMS open and inclusive. We expect all contributors to follow the spirit of a professional and welcoming community.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please search the [issues](https://github.com/KumoCMS/kumocms.github.io/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue and include:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected behavior versus actual behavior.
- Any relevant screenshots or error logs.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before starting work on them.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that Pull Request!

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Code Review Process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. 
- General changes require approval from the **@KumoCMS/maintainers** team.
- Changes to GitHub Actions or security configurations in `.github/workflows/` require approval from **@KumoCMS/tech-leads**.

The **CODEOWNERS** file in this repository automatically assigns the appropriate reviewers to your Pull Request based on the files changed.
